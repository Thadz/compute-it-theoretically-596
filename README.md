## Why are there *.pdf files and *.md files?

Usually you **only** need to download the *.pdf files.

All *.pdf files are generated from coressponding *.md files by LaTeX and pandoc. There are *.md files because one can easily change them and generate *.pdf files. On the other hand, in case you don't have the dependencies to generate those *.pdf files, the latest *.pdf files are also pushed into this repo.

## Dependencies to build
LaTeX (TeX Live can be downloaded [here](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html))

pandoc (the universal document coverter, which can be downloaded [here](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html))
