# Critical thinking matters, as always.

## The biggest breaking news this week!
- the tragedy that one makes false assumption
- OpenSSL Heartbeat Vulnerability [*link*](http://vimeo.com/91425662)

# [Exercise] @Hopcroft01 [p.281] example 7.2.5

## Do you know $\{a^nb^nc^i\vert i\neq n\}$ is actually **not** context-free.
- But it is Turing-recognizable.
- Describe it informally first.
- Write out the configurations for the input $abcc$.

# [Exercise] @[NYU CS HW](http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall03/V22.0453-001/hw5.pdf)

## Try to build a Turing machine that transforms a unary string into its binary representation.
- Describe it informally first.
- Write out the configurations for the input $11111$.

# [Exercise] @from no where else

## Try to build a Turing machine that can operate division on two unary strings (0 excluded).
- Describe it informally first.
- Write out the configurations for the input $1111\#11$.

# [Exercise] @Sipser13 [p.157] exercise 2.33

## Show that $\{a^ib^j\vert i=kj\mbox{ for some positive integer }k\}$ is Turing-recognizable.

# [Exercise] @Sipser13 [p.157] exercise 2.30

## Show that $\{w\#t\vert w\mbox{ is a substring of } t,\mbox{ where }w,t\in\{a,b\}^*\}$ is Turing-recognizable.
