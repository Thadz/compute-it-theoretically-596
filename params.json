There are *.md files because one can easily change them and generate *.pdf files. On the other hand, in case you don't have the dependencies to generate those *.pdf files, the latest *.pdf files are also pushed into this repo.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies to build\r\nLaTeX (TeX Live can be downloaded [here](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html))\r\n\r\npandoc (the universal document coverter, which can be downloaded [here](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html))\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
